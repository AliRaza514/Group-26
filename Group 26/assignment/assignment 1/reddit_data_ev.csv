"General Questions and Purchasing Advice Thread — Week of February 10, 2025","**Need help choosing an EV, finding a home charger, or understanding whether you're eligible for a tax credit? Vehicle and product recommendation requests, buying experiences, and questions on credits/financing are all fair game here.** 

# Is an EV right for me? 

Generally speaking, electric vehicles imply a larger upfront cost than a traditional vehicle, but will pay off over time as your consumables cost (electricity instead of fuel) can be anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 the cost. Calculators are available to help you estimate cost — here are some we recommend:

Traded my '22 model 3 for a 25 M59 and dammmmnnn,"I was in negotiation to sell the model 3 when I thought I had a deal on an ioniq 5 limited. The deal fell through on the Hyundai but not the model 3 so I was without a car for a few days. I decided to rent an ioniq while I continued to look for a car. 

I had negotiated a deal for an M50 from a local BMW dealership but I didn't like the deal. I posted it on leasehackr and people were like nah fam.

I was deeply regretting selling the Tesla. But because of you all, I reached out to Zack at ZZ Auto in SoCal. He worked out a deal on an M50 that was better than the deals I was getting on the ioniq or the other M50. He was fantastic!

I'm paying less now than I was for the model 3 and for me it is a better car. I thought I would miss the Tesla but not even 1 cm. I've been a BMW driver my entire adult life until the Tesla and it is so good to be back in a car with excellent suspension, better turning, better feel. And a lot less noisy. A lot. I got the Harman kardon package and the sound system is fantastic. A lot more clear than the model 3. 

I think the ioniq is a fantastic car for the price. Unbeatable. But I'm all about performance and willing to pay a bit more for it.

I was taking some pictures and a super hot woman walked by and said nice wheels! I never got that in the model 3. Also before you thathappened me, I'm a straight woman but I still loved this moment. I would have switched teams if I could.

The things I like more are the feel of the car, the hud, the interior comfort, Android auto, the overall look though I still don't love the huge grill in front. Things that feel basically the same is the one pedal driving, the sound system is better and more clear in the BMW but it's not a huge difference. What I miss is the Tesla had more containers including back pockets on the seats for stuff in the cabin. And I liked reverse and drive on the steering wheel versus in the center but I'll get used to that. I also liked that I didn't actually have to start the car.

Walk away locking is just as good. Actually it happens a little bit faster which I like. I don't have to just stand there and wait. I like having more physical buttons. The acceleration is just as panty dropping. Like I said the turns are much better.

Model 3 is still a fantastic car, but I have zero regrets getting rid of it. Especially since now I'm not sending a message I don't intend to send. And I don't have to have a silly bumper sticker on my car anymore.

I have at home charging and in my 3 years of having the model 3 I only charged it externally once, So that wasn't really a variable but the range seems similar by all reports. I am very happy!

Now I just have to find a good place in SoCal to get the windows tinted.",Toosder,38,2/16/2025 3:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iqje9l/traded_my_22_model_3_for_a_25_m59_and_dammmmnnn/,76,electricvehicles

Calculate just for fun.,"New question.

Assume ioniq 5 with 245kW charging speed (it has a very good charging curve too). Assume it is summer and the battery is preconditioned. Charging stations are available every 5 miles for next 1000miles.


According to EPA, an AWD model would get 242 miles range (100% battery). Let's assume those exact weather conditions.

Now, would it be better to go fast like 79 to 84mph and charge to 90% which takes 30mins and travel only 200 miles.

Over EPA speed for 242 miles first, then 10-80% at 18mins for the rest of the trip? 

Let's assume we are traveling 1000miles to destination. 

Additional breaks not needed, as we will take care of food and restroom breaks etc during charging sessions. ",theepi_pillodu,4,2/16/2025 13:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iqrwgt/calculate_just_for_fun/,18,electricvehicles

I was an early reservation holder for the Cybertruck but I bought the Lighting and traded my Model3 for a ZDX for the wife.,"Truly a love hate relationship.

In 2017 I was traveling 134 + up to 20 miles additionally round trip everyday for work.  I had scaled down from my 2013 Tundra to a used 04 Prius with  140k miles on it in the effort to save money.  
I dove deep into hypermiling and without being crazy and doing over the top aerodynamic mods, I was averaging about $200 in gas every month and a $50 oil change monthly for every 5k miles.
I started looking into PHV’s and the best I could find at the time was 40 miles of range before turning to ICE.  While driving around one day,  I passed the Tesla Dealership in Springfield NJ.  I had only just learned of the Tesla Model S and thought they were basically a novelty much like the fisher Ocean.  Didn’t know much but thought let me stop.  The Salesperson introduced me to the model 3 and I fell in LOVE.  The technology and sportiness and it was unusual.   To boot,  no oil changes,  no brakes in 115k miles and my electricity bill only went up $100.  Totally worth it! 
I saw so much potential in the technology and became a quick fan boy.  Started following Elon on Twitter and would watch Tesla time news.  I even convinced my wife to let me invest $35k in TSLA.  And that’s where the journey changed.
Not knowing much about markets, and missing out on opportunities like google and Apple, I jumped on Schwab and hit buy.
This was fitting the time Elmo was dropping hints about the coming truck and boy that’s what I really wanted. An Electric pick up. So I hit buy and like the true fan boy I was, I checked twitter for Elmo updates.  I shit you not,  2 minutes after hitting buy,  he tweets, “I think my stock is overpriced”.   And I watched the value of the stock plummet $200.  I was mortified at my decision.  I felt foolish, but I held. And it all worked out. I held through both Stock Splits and made quite a bit of money.
Unfortunately, as I held on to that stock and watched it grow, it blinded me from what was really going on.  The tweets got uglier and uglier. But I still bought my second Model3. 

But enough became enough.  When Elmo endorsed Trump, I sold all my shares as a start.  And today, we traded my girl in for an Acura ZDX for my wife.  

We feel lighter not being saddled with a symbol of hate.  The car was amazing for being the pioneer it was.  But the quality of other EV’s that are out here now is worlds better.  Still behind on the software, but I have realized we are still in the novelty stage with the software anyway.

Electric vehicle market trends: Conquest insights by brand,"For this study, we looked at 29 newly released BEV models to assess their ability to conquest new customers into the brand. To qualify, the vehicle must have met certain criteria:

Be on the market in October 2024.
Have at least 15 months of data available (3-month launch period plus 12 months of data).
Minimum of 1,000 return-to-market (RTM) count from launch through October 2024.
Conquest rates and electric vehicle market trends
Generally, BEV models conquest new customers into the brand at a higher rate than the brand average. In this study, more than two-thirds of the BEVs outperformed their respective brands.

Top three performers:
Hyundai Ioniq 5: 74.2% were conquests from competitive brands, which is 21.7 percentage points better than the Hyundai brand overall.
Cadillac Lyriq: 72.6% were conquests from competitive brands, which is 16.0 percentage points better than the Cadillac brand.
GMC Hummer EV (pickup): 71.3% were conquests from competitive brands, which is 16.3 percentage points better than the GMC brand.
Lowest three performers:
Toyota BZ4X: 33.5% were conquests from competitive brands, 7 percentage points below Toyota brand.
Nissan Ariya: 40.9% were conquests from competitive brands, 0.4 percentage points below Nissan brand.
Subaru Solterra: 45.3% were conquests from competitive brands, 2.3 percentage points below Subaru brand.
Also noteworthy is the fact that Ford is attracting new customers at a relatively high rate. The Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning are two of the top three models in conquest rates relative to the brand average. The conquest rates for both Ford EVs were more than 20 percentage points above the Ford brand average. ­",Bravadette,12,2/15/2025 21:19,https://www.spglobal.com/automotive-insights/en/blogs/2025/02/electric-vehicle-market-trends-conquest-insights?fbclid=IwY2xjawId46hleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHRK1q_P2yhiFAkao16vux8OUxjlia2-un-qKxHTgiO7tBxwo7F7EGuzz0Q_aem_6oRiAr4-js_YPk-lznyyOw,3,electricvehicles
Will EVs in the US market catch up?,"I speak not in terms of sales, but in terms of the technology. Things such as charging speed, charging curve, battery density, ADAS, and other general tech features.

I read more and more about the leaps and bounds that Chinese EVs have made within the last 5 years and how they’re so ahead of everyone else in terms of EV technology.

I understand that Chinese EVs aren’t perfect and they have flaws too. But as of right now, they are seen as the best in terms of EV tech. 

Will EVs sold for the US market eventually catchup to the technology of Chinese EVs?

Road trip rental with G80e,"Hello,

I am considering renting a G80e through avis to do a yosemite road trip from SF later this year. I'm a bit uncertain about charging the car. From my understanding, if I get a newer model, it comes with the NACS port which can charge at any tesla supercharger. However, if I get an older model, it comes with a CCS port which would need an adaptor. Would someone be able to clarify this for me? Also, does any know if avis would provide a NACS to CCS converter in that case? Thank you!",Big_Log_4062,1,2/16/2025 4:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iqjxrj/road_trip_rental_with_g80e/,3,electricvehicles
New US and Canadian CCS chargers in January 2025,"Hey electrons,

**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in January 2025,** according to the US Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 276 CCS charging stations with a total of 793 chargepoints added or refreshed in January 2025.** For comparison, there were 205 new CCS charging stations in January 2024, with 381 chargepoints.

This month saw a solid increase over January of last year, and was comparable to November 2024, but nowhere near the levels seen in December of last year. That may very well have been caused by a rush to finish projects before the Trump administration could stop the flow of funds, but I don't have direct evidence of it.

Some of these stations are Tesla Magic Dock stations. That makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle. **Be aware some stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,** which may require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

Tesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Ford, Rivian, Hyundai and GM owners can now order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle. Others are coming soon.

However, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only *some* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, both those that support *all* CCS vehicles and those that only support the manufacturers currently permitted to use an adapter.

**""What about non-Tesla EVs with a built-in NACS port? Can they use all superchargers?""**

So far there is only one sold in volume: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Even with a built-in NACS port, it can only use newer superchargers (generation 3 or better). However, with this car, you do not have to block two stalls to use a short Supercharger cord, which is a big advantage.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

Please ask me questions if needed.",Timely-You-1981,0,2/16/2025 0:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iqga5m/south_texas_to_washington_state_road_trip_in_a/,2,electricvehicles
Thoughts on renting a F150 lightning for a week (as a model Y owner),"Background:  
I own a 2023 model Y and a 2015 ICE F150.  In spite of recent events I love my Tesla.  The family went on vacation and we lucked out with the rental company and got a 2024 F150 lightning. 


The good: 
It feels like a truck, with all the benefits of an EV.  It still has some of the acceleration I love about EVs.  I've grown used to not having buttons in the Tesla, but there are a handful that are really useful (volume, temperature, etc).  Although honestly Ford could lose half the buttons and still be ok.  I loved the top down view in reverse, extremely useful with a big truck.  I loved having the stats on the dash (speed, charge level, etc), but not a deal breaker.


The bad:
The infotainment is miles behind Tesla.  I loved being able to use Android Auto, but I honestly don't miss it at all in the Tesla.  I miss the AI detection of speed limit signs as the maps were wrong on a couple occasions.  Although not a Ford issue, having to use third party chargers was a huge turn off.  Since it was a rental I couldn't use an adapter with Tesla's supercharger network.  I had so many problems with chargers in a single week I can see why people get frustrated.   While I've owned a very similar sized F150 for years, it's used as a backup vehicle to the Tesla and for towing.  Using it as a family vehicle was cumbersome, it's just too big.  EDIT:  going with traffic  on the freeway is brutal, I can almost feel the battery drain in real time.


The bottom line: 
Love the lightning, and probably would have gotten one if they were not so expensive and hard to find when we bought the Tesla.  With all of that said, my only real complaint is the infotainment.  Everything else is not really a lightning problem.  It's too large as a family vehicle, but that's an F150 issue not a lightning specific one.  If only someone would make a smaller 4 door EV truck that could handle light towing and the occasional trip to home Depot.",Simon-is-IT,27,2/15/2025 3:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ipsp43/thoughts_on_renting_a_f150_lightning_for_a_week/,80,electricvehicles

Is My Volkswagen Passat PHEV Charging Too Slowly? Seeking Insights,"I’ve had my 2025 Volkswagen Passat plug-in hybrid (PHEV) for a couple of months now, and I specifically chose this model because of its 50 kW DC fast-charging capacity, thinking it would be great for road trips. However, when I take it to fast chargers rated at 300+ kW, the best charging speed I’ve ever seen is 15 kW—far below what I expected.

For context:
	•	Temperatures have been between 26°F and 46°F (-3°C to 8°C) since I got the car.
	•	I mostly use a home trickle charger (which works fine for daily use), but I’m concerned about road trips as the weather warms up.
	•	I’ve only used public fast chargers, not home DC charging.
	•	I know cold weather affects charging speeds, but this seems like an extreme reduction.

Is this kind of speed normal for winter conditions with a PHEV? Can I expect an improvement once the weather warms up? Are there settings, preconditioning steps, or other factors that could be affecting my charging speed? I’d appreciate any insights from other Passat PHEV owners or EV enthusiasts who’ve experienced similar issues!",RamMasterFlash84,3,2/15/2025 8:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ipx76n/is_my_volkswagen_passat_phev_charging_too_slowly/,61,electricvehicles

Hertz EV Rental in LAX as a Foreigner,"Hi, I'm a foreigner who is going to LAX soon and by far, the cheapest option for Hertz car rental is the Intermediate Electric Elite (Polestar 2 or similar). I also just signed up for the Hertz Gold Reward free membership, if it changes anything. I also have never driven an EV.

Now I have read many reviews discouraging foreigners (especially ones new to EV) from renting EV as it can be a headache, from queuing up in charging stations, to broken chargers, to payment cards not working.

Questions:

1. I was wondering if I could still proceed to book this Intermediate Electric Elite option and then just ask them to change my car preference as I pick it up? Is this a ""perk"" of being a free gold member? Or will I still get up-charged?

2. I have also read that Teslas are a good starting point for EV beginners as it is more straightforward to use, such as at Tesla superchargers. If this is the case, would they allow me to switch to a Tesla? Or should I completely stop trying to rent an EV?

Polestar 2 LR DM vs. BMW i4 eDrive40,"My currenct company car is almost at the end of its lease so I had to choose a new one. I narrowed down the list to the 2 mentioned models and I wanted to share my experiences and I hope it can be of help for anyone who would be in the same situation. TLDR at the end.

On paper I would choose the Polestar 2 as currently there is a 'Business Edition' that adds the 3 main option packages for free. I would be able to almost choose it full option within the budget I get from my company. It also has more power than the BMW and it has 4WD.

Last Monday I had a test drive with both of the cars. The Polestar was up first and I didn't really click with it. Sure it has a lot of power when you put your foot down which is always fun, but to my feeling the throttle pedal is not very responsive. There is like a little bit of delay until the power kicks in. Inside the car I also felt like there was not that much of space as a driver. I'm rather small (1,68m) but with the center console being so wide I felt like I didn't have enough room. It touched my leg during driving and when I was driving on cruise control I couldn't really get a comfortable position for my leg. The arm rest above the cup holders was also not really good as I rested my arm more on the sloping parts of the center console than on the actual arm rest. Apart from this the car is ok to drive with and the Android Auto infotainment system is also easy to work with.

Next up was the BMW and from the first moment this car felt so much better to drive with. It's much quieter inside (I drove both cars on the highway and secundary roads) and more comfortable when going over bumps and potholes (and we sure do have a lot of these here in Belgium). The throttle is much more responsive and although the car has less power than the Polestar it still does have enough power to have a pleasant ride. The cockpit feels much more spacious and is more comfortable to sit in. The infotainment system works well and has wireless Carplay, opposed to the Polestar which only has wired Carplay.

As I was leaning more towards the Polestar initially (on paper, before the test drives) but my feeling completely switched and I was really more convinced of the BMW. I was able to get a quote from the dealer with the options that mattered most to me for more or less the same budget as the Polestar 2. After some days of thinking and discussing it with my wife I ended up ordering the BMW and it really feels as the best decision for me and I'm really happy with my choice.

Looking forward to September now when it will be delivered :-)

TLDR: I ended up choosing the BMW which drives much better than the Polestar 2 but it comes with a bigger price tag so I had to compensate a little bit in the chosen options but I was able to get the things that matter to me within my budget.

Does EVs heating system are generally bad compared to ICE cars?,"Hey,

I have some issues with my EV. You can have a look at my post here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/peugeot/comments/1ipycsq/peugeot_e208_issues/

My question is, does EVs heating system are really that bad or my car is the problem? This is my first EV so coming from an ICE car I get used to that no matter what, if I turned on the heating it was ON without any restrictions. If I turned ON the heated seats or steering wheel it was ON all the time. Never let me down. But here I am in winter and my heating system is rubbish, I feel like the heat pump gives me absolutely no benefit. The battery just tank like crazy. I just need a clarification that it is a general thing or this specific car or brand is the one to avoid in the future.
Thank you!

I thought this would help drive EV adoption by making people comfortable with charging, range anxiety, etc...

The US needs far more hybrid vehicles than pure BEVs,"The US is short 128gw of capacity for the next five years, caused by data centers and manufacturing.

[https://www.utilitydive.com/news/shocking-forecast-us-electricity-load-could-grow-128-gw-over-next-5-years-Grid-Strategies/734820/](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/shocking-forecast-us-electricity-load-could-grow-128-gw-over-next-5-years-Grid-Strategies/734820/)

For example, Microsoft bought 100% of power generated by Three Mile Island when it reopens, until 2048.

[https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-to-return-as-microsoft-signs-20-year-835mw-ai-data-center-ppa/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-to-return-as-microsoft-signs-20-year-835mw-ai-data-center-ppa/)

It's not a given but it's possible that DCFC gets throttled in the next few years, changing the driving equation.  Both from power companies as well as by shared power for more chargers per location.

This did not pass but it shows recognition of a grid problem, that we can't get enough power to where people need it for dcfc.

[https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-tonko-introduce-ev-grid-act-meet-increasing-electricity-demand-ev](https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-tonko-introduce-ev-grid-act-meet-increasing-electricity-demand-ev)

**DCFC**

The demand for dcfc would be so big that current shortage is only 250kwh 365,714 DC fast chargers at once. With perfect change over (no one uses more than 30 minutes) only about 13.165 million vehicles could charge per day at that rate.

The US has 283.5 million vehicles, so you could charge every 21 days.    17 times per year

The average miles driven per year is about 14,500.   Requiring you to get 850 miles of range in 30 minutes only dc fast charging.

So to support 100% EVs using only dc fast charging the country needs about 500gigawatts of capacity just for EVs.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

So 100% dcfc seems unrealistic to get rid of gas vehicles on a 20 year timeline, if we assume they build that 128gw in the next five years

**L2**

If we switch to only 7.7kwh charging (30 @ 240) and people charge overnight mainly.

283.5 million cars would mostly be charged in two shifts of 8 hours each.  Home overnight and work during business hours. Very roughly this should account for overlap, fewer but longer sessions by some and weird schedules.  That's 141.75 million vehicles at once L2 charging.

For a BEV getting 60 miles each day would need to charge about 230 times per year per vehicle given 8 hours.   We basically need full capacity for 141.7 million vehicles at all times

That's 1091gigawatts of power needed

It's a lot higher due to more concurrent demand for longer in the day.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

**The problem**

The assumption of this is we cannot build that many fast chargers on any given timeframe.  It's easier to install slow chargers.

The average BEV range is about 300 miles.  Need to charge about 50 times a year, so once a week, if we could fast charge every week.

If we had perfect turnover and people that's a need for 15.75 million DC Fast chargers in the US, all  being used perfectly for 18 hours a day.  No idle time, someone is always waiting for you to end at every single one of them.  While that's not reasonable what does that require?

At $50k each that's $787,500,000,000 needed for chargers

NEVI is a $5 billion program for one year.  Even when running it's off by a factor of 150x.  We need to scale up charger funding to be over $35 billion every year for 20-years (to stay in line with potential generation scale up)

L2 chargers are cheaper, at an average of about $3500.  But needing one per every two vehicles it's only $495,950,000,000 in cost.  Still a lot of money.

The issue with going to an electric future isn't demand, it's electrical capacity and charger cost.

**Where Do We Put Them?**

About 2/3 of housing has a driveway.  Including all parking, only 48% have private parking.

Shared parking muddies things.  Imagine an apartment complex with 200 spots for 100 units.

People like to get a spot closest to their unit.  And what about guests?   The complex even adding 20 L2 chargers could cost be $1 million and they aren't going to be in the right places for anyone needing them.  They aren't going to be turned over well when people sit in the spot all night.   So long term will need more and more and more dedicated chargers.

Half the country is in a situation where charging is a pain.

The other half can charge overnight if they spend the money, and many can't.

Having a driveway doesn't mean their landlord will install one.  What if they need to upgrade the panel first?  About 30% of all homes have a 100 amp panel.

So even those who charge at home have problems to solve

So we need lots of public slow chargers and people today who don't want to pay the dcfc premium to be using them for many hours every day.

That 14500 miles is 39 per day.  Most people would be well served with a hybrid that can go 70-80 miles per full charge and charge nightly with grid management software determining when they need to be charged by.  You may be forced start at 1am, 3am or such to spread out demand.

**The answer?**

A slowdown in EV sales is coming as a result.  We aren't scaling up charging fast enough.  We're building out charging an order of magnitude slower than is needed.

The average car lasts 12.6 years.  That means half of all vehicles are over 13 years old.

A very rough estimate has 7% of cars on the road todays as EV in the US.

[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924)

The answer is we need far more plug in hybrid models on the market in the next decade.   We need to slow down dcfc electrical demand by shifting sales away from BEVs.

The rest of the world is already heading that way.  1/3 of cars in Europe are hybrids and in China hybrid sales doubled and phevs could have a larger market share in a few years.

The exact numbers vary by country.  It appears to depend on how far people drive.  Norway is small and compact and as a result fewer than 10% of new electric vehicles are hybrids.   The US is large and low density so I would expect hybrids dominate electric vehicle sales long-term.   Cities like NYC will rely on public charging so I expect those with cars choose hybrids to have options.
